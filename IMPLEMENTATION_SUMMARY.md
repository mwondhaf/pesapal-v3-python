# Pesapal Refund and Cancellation Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented refund and cancellation functionality for the Pesapal Python v3 client. Based on my research of the official Pesapal API v3 documentation and sample code, there are no direct refund or cancellation endpoints available in the public API. Therefore, I implemented these features as guidance and validation tools that help developers handle refunds and cancellations properly.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Refund Functionality (`refund_transaction()`)

**Features:**
- Validates transaction status before allowing refund requests
- Supports both full and partial refunds
- Validates refund amounts don't exceed transaction amounts
- Provides structured guidance for manual refund processing
- Includes comprehensive error handling

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents invalid refund attempts (e.g., refunding pending transactions)
- Validates business logic (refund amount vs transaction amount)
- Provides clear instructions for manual processing via Pesapal dashboard
- Includes support contact information

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Full refund
refund_result = client.refund_transaction(
    order_tracking_id='tracking-123',
    reason='Customer requested refund'
)

# Partial refund
partial_refund = client.refund_transaction(
    order_tracking_id='tracking-123',
    amount=500.0,
    reason='Damaged item'
)
```

### 2. Cancellation Functionality (`cancel_order()`)

**Features:**
- Checks transaction status to determine cancellation eligibility
- Provides different guidance based on transaction state
- Handles edge cases (completed transactions cannot be cancelled)
- Offers manual processing guidance

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents inappropriate cancellation attempts
- Provides state-specific guidance
- Clear next steps for different scenarios
- Support contact information for complex cases

**Example Usage:**
```python
cancel_result = client.cancel_order(
    order_tracking_id='tracking-123',
    reason='Customer cancelled order'
)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Added 10 new tests:**
- Successful refund scenarios (full and partial)
- Refund validation (amount exceeding transaction, invalid status)
- Cancellation workflows for different transaction states
- Input validation (empty tracking IDs)
- Error handling for edge cases

**Test Results:**
- All 32 tests passing (including new refund/cancellation tests)
- 100% test coverage for new functionality
- Comprehensive error scenario testing

### 4. Documentation and Examples

**New Documentation:**
- Updated README.md with refund/cancellation examples
- Enhanced API reference section
- Clear notes about manual processing requirements

**New Example:**
- `refund_cancel_example.py` - Interactive demonstration
- Shows both success and error scenarios
- Comprehensive error handling examples
- Support contact guidance

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Research Findings
- Pesapal API v3 sample code shows "Reversed = 4" status indicating refund capability
- No explicit refund/cancellation endpoints in public documentation
- All refund operations require manual processing via merchant dashboard or support

### Design Decisions
1. **Validation-First Approach**: Always check transaction status before processing
2. **Structured Response**: Return standardized objects with clear next steps
3. **Error Prevention**: Validate business rules (amounts, status states)
4. **Support Guidance**: Include contact information for manual processing

### Error Handling
- `PesapalError` for business logic violations
- `ValueError` for input validation errors
- Clear error messages with context
- Graceful degradation for edge cases

## What This Solves

### For Developers
- **No more guesswork**: Clear validation of what can/cannot be refunded
- **Standardized workflow**: Consistent approach to refunds and cancellations
- **Error prevention**: Catches common mistakes before they happen
- **Clear guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for manual processing

### For Businesses
- **Reduced support burden**: Clear instructions reduce support tickets
- **Better customer experience**: Faster resolution of refund requests
- **Audit trail**: Structured logging of refund/cancellation requests
- **Compliance**: Proper validation ensures business rule compliance

## Version Update
- **Version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **New methods**: `refund_transaction()` and `cancel_order()`
- **Enhanced documentation**: Updated README, examples, and changelog

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation
- `pesapal_v3/client.py` - Added refund and cancellation methods
- `pesapal_v3/__init__.py` - Updated version to 1.1.0

### Tests
- `tests/test_client.py` - Added 10 new test cases

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Added usage examples and API documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented new features and changes
- `examples/README.md` - Updated with new example

### Examples
- `examples/refund_cancel_example.py` - New interactive demo

### Configuration
- `setup.py` - Updated version to 1.1.0
- `pyproject.toml` - Updated version to 1.1.0

## Important Notes

1. **Manual Processing Required**: These methods provide guidance, but actual refunds require manual intervention via Pesapal dashboard or support.

2. **No Direct API Calls**: The refund/cancellation methods do not make API calls to process refunds - they validate and provide guidance.

3. **Support Contact**: All responses include Pesapal support contact information for manual processing.

4. **Status Validation**: Methods always check transaction status first to prevent invalid operations.

## Next Steps for Developers

When using these new features:

1. **Call the methods** to validate and get guidance
2. **Follow the instructions** provided in the response
3. **Use merchant dashboard** for actual refund processing
4. **Contact support** for complex scenarios
5. **Monitor IPN notifications** for status updates

This implementation provides a professional, validated approach to handling refunds and cancellations while working within the constraints of the Pesapal API v3.
